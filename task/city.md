## Ludhiana City Facts  :grin:

Fondly called as the Manchester of India and the Cultural-cum-Industrial capital of Punjab, Ludhiana as a city has grown manifolds over the past few decades.

**Language :** The regional language out here is Punjabi. Unlike many other Indian regional languages, Punjabi is easy to understand, posing not too many problems to the tourist. Much can be attributed to the similarity it holds with the national language Hindi.

**Traffic :** The traffic out here does get congested and it is best to travel either via two-wheelers or auto rickshaws in the interiors. The amount of two-wheelers and four wheelers here are probably the highest in the country.

**Safety :** As with the most of the cities, the intra-city areas are very safe even during the night. Venturing alone or into unknown areas on the outskirts is not advisable. Though Ludhiana does not report of very serious crime rates, petty thefts etc. are to be watched out for. Do not stop to give lifts or to ask directions during night times in isolated areas.

**currency:**  Indian Rupee is the used currency. Many new currency exchange points and ATM centers have come up all over the city over the last few years making money very easily accessible for visitors. Always carry loose change in coins for urgent calls, parking etc. One should beware of the Rs 500 notes, check them before using.

**Ludhianvis:** Ludhianvi is definitely much more relaxed and friendly than the average Punjabi. A warm greeting about his well-being will do him in and mind you, he�s very touchy about Ludhiana. The most outstanding aspect of Ludhiana and its people is the sound balance they have maintained between modernity and their age-old rich culture and tradition. No wonder, it�s called the �Cultural-cum-Industrial Capital of Punjab� as well as �The Manchester of India�.
